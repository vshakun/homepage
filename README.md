# CS50-PSet-8-Homepage

This is my code for the CS50 simple hompage using HTML, CSS, JavaScript for Harvard's CS50 problems set 8.

## Specifications:

### Implement in your homepage directory a website that must:

1. Contain at least four different .html pages and it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page.
2. Use at least ten distinct HTML tags besides `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, and `<title>`.
3. Integrate one or more features from Bootstrap into your site.
