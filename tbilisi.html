        <h2>Tbilisi</h2>
            <p>No other city in Europe is as curious as Tbilisi right now. On the edge of Asia with a Soviet past, it’s a multi-layered hub with irresistible energy.</p>

                            <p>This historic capital city in the heart of Georgia has been built and rebuilt dozens of times—yet the cobblestone streets of its famed Old Town neighborhood have somehow remained untouched. Travelers can wander the back alleyways passed picture-perfect balconies, through winding streets the loop past ancient churches and tiny shops in what feels almost like a walk through time. Art lovers will enjoy Tiflis Avenue, where galleries line Old Town streets like King Erekle II. Exhibitions take place on a rolling basis in this part of the neighborhood that’s known for its large collection of contemporary Georgian art. Two of the city’s oldest churches, famed sulfur baths, and incredible views of Narikala Fortress and Mtsasminda are also a part of life in Old Town. Those looking for a bit of nightlife can tuck into a table at the hip Kala café and restaurant—an Old Town staple—for an evening of life jazz and a delicious, traditional Georgian meal.</p>

                            <p>This former Persian citadel it one of the most recognizable structures in the Old Town skyline and travelers who venture to this 4th century wonder are rewarded with some of the best views of Tbilisi in the city. Narikala is divided into two sections (thanks to walls erected by Arab emirs in the 8th century), with St. Nicholas Church, built in the 1990s, on the lower level. The Mother Georgia monument is also within walking distance. Travelers say that while there isn’t much to see in the fortress itself, the grounds do offer a bit of historical context and spectacular views make it worth a visit.</p>

                            <p> As any traveller to Georgia will tell you, the country’s unique cuisine, wine culture and the ritual of the supra (Georgian feast) are all highlights. While some of Russia’s gastronomic traits do carry over (read: lots of carbs, dairy and red meat), religious customs that call for meat-free dining at certain times of year means there are lots of options available for vegetarians. Inflected with aromatics and a surprisingly liberal use of chilli (thanks in part to its Persian and Turkish neighbours to the south), Georgian cooking also features loads of fresh herbs and some of the tastiest locally grown produce you’re likely to encounter anywhere in the world.</p>

                            <p>The towering Holy Trinity Cathedral is the tallest church in all of Tbilisi and recognized as a symbol of ”New Georgia”. Its golden dome rises out of the hillside of St. Ilya and is visible from almost any point in the city. The stunning structure is part of a massive complex that includes a monastery, theology school, hotel and nine chapels (including five that are underground). Long considered one of the highlights of any tour of Tbilisi, Holy Trinity Cathedral was built to coincide with the 2000th anniversary of Christianity and the 1,500th anniversary of the Georgian church’s independence. The cathedral’s interior proves as impressive as its exterior and travelers say it is worth visiting twice—once to see in the daylight, and once to see as the sun sets in the hills that surround it.</p>
